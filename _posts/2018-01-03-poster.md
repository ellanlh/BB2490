Since last time, our group has worked a bit on the poster, and it's almost finished. Panos has, as I've mentioned in the last post, focused on finalizing the part where we are using `MUMmer` to compare the sequences and Maria has primarily helped me with the poster, writing texts and adding figures. We have also had a break over Christmas which was well needed.

{% include image.html
            img="assets/images/poster.png"
            title="posterscreenshot"
            caption="A screenshot of the how the poster looks at the time of publishing this post."
            url="" %}

Today we ran `MUMmer` again to create a coverage plot with different colours to be added to the poster. While it was running we worked on the poster and discussed what results we wanted to add and what conclusions to write. 

After some feedback from Lars regarding the usage of `MUMmer`, and the plots it can generate, we seem to be on the right track. For the upcoming days, we will work on the details of the poster and also upload data on CANVAS including a genome assembly description and the final `.fa`-file for Lars (and whoever) to look at. 

We have also e-mailed the final assembly to Lars with the relevant statistics. I will post once more with all of the final results and conclusions, after the exams, and when the poster is finished.
