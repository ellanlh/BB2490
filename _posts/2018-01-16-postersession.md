Yesterday we presented our poster at SciLife! It went very well and people seemed interested in our project. We were told several times that the poster was very appealing and one even said it was the best looking one, and for that we are very happy! Here is the poster as presented yesterday: 

{% include image.html
            img="assets/images/postersession.png"
            title="postersession"
            caption="Our poster during the conference."
            url="" %}

We noticed that what people found to be most difficult to understand was the coverage plot which we also struggled with to fully understand and to present in a good way with colours etc. But I think most understood after having it explained a bit extra. Other than that, there didn't seem to be anything unclear about the poster or the project. 

With that I think this is my last post and I want to thank Stefan Ã…hman for helping me with any issue I had with Github or uploading of posts, and Oscar He for giving advice to our project and tips. Additionally, I want to thank Lars Arvestad, one of the course teachers who helped us answering questions during the project and giving us feedback. Thank you!
