The final poster is ready and can be seen here (digital version):
{% include image.html
            img="assets/images/finalposter.png"
            title="finalposterscreenshot"
            caption="Screenshot of the final poster."
            url="" %}

Today the poster was also printed in AlbaNova which means we are done with the last part of the project. The Gantt-schedule (having been revised very little) can be seen here: 

{% include image.html
            img="assets/images/gantt.png"
            title="Ganttschema"
            caption="Current Gantt schedule"
            url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M503DbvbETeQcMXRS_NrsiHvb-OUr5MgFAd9eww9qJw/edit?usp=sharing" %}

We are really happy with the poster; both the content and the look of it. What remains now is talking through it, making sure we understand and know all the content before the poster presentation the 15th of January. 

Below I have summarized our final conclusions. 

- From the available data it was not possible to fully assemble the genome of *P. andina*, but to create contigs long enough to be further studied. 
- *P. andina* contains parts of the CHS gene from *P. infestans*, *P. sojae*, and *P. ramorum*. This indicates that thsoe parts of the gene are highly conserved and important as it can be found in several species. 
- It is not possible to determine what the unknown species is as the CHS gene could have been inherited from either of these three species and many others that have not been studies in this project. 
- The largest contigs of *P. andina* matches the *P. infestans* genome. This confirms that *P. infestans* and *P. andina* are related. 

As future aspects, there are two major points we want to mention. 

- To fully assemble the genome of *P. andina*, better data is needed. A suggestion is to sequence the genome again to ibtain paired-end reads data which could result in a more accurate assembly than single-end reads. 
- To determine the unknown species, wes uggest making genome comprisons between *P. andina* and *P. sojae* and *P. ramorum*. Also, we suggest to include other species like for example *P. parasitica* and *S. parasitica*. 

Now we will prep for the poster presentation, and come back with feedback we get. See you there!
